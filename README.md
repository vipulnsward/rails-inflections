# Rails::Inflections

Rails Inflections are frozen, and mostly broken for edge cases. This gem tries to add/fix/modify inflections, not accepted
into rails code base. Most of the code is from the rails code base along with the test cases. Rails::Inflections just 
adds some fixes on top of it.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails-inflections'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails-inflections

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here
